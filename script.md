# Script Presentation

Hello everyone!

Thanks for the invitation and giving me the opportunity to present our current work and the work of the last years. And also to give some perspectives on vegetation modeling and representation shift in this seminar.

I think there is a lot to do in the intersection of Remote Sensing, Environmental Science and Machine learning where a vital exchange and common understanding will be beneficial and push the developments forward. Effetively to address meaningful and real-world applications that have an actual positive impact on a global scale.

## Slide Structure

I chose three parts in the title of this presentation that I want to address sequentially throughout the next slides.

First, Data-driven vegetation modeling. Why it is a vegetation classification a meaningful and still challenging application and how we use modern machine learning for classifying crop types compared to prior model-driven methods.
Second, how does representation shift arise naturally when doing vegetation classification on a large scale. In a real-world case we typically never want to train and test data from the same location. Still on our experiments benchmarks we do regularly to avoid this issue.
Third, the meta-learning perspective to see our datasets as "datasets-of-datasets". And model-agnostic meta-learning in particular as one algorithm to address this representation shift using few labeled samples (few-shot learning).
